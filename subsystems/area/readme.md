# Area subsystem

An area is a place where alerts can be issued for. An area describes a geographic to which the alert info applies. Textual and coded descriptions (such as postal codes) are supported, but the preferred representations use geospatial shapes (polygons and circles).

The [Area subsystem](/subsystems/area/readme.md) is a set of components that together allow for the management and publication of the set of areas.

Responsible for:

- Managing flood area data and other geospatial areas
- Managing 
- Publishing versioned datasets
